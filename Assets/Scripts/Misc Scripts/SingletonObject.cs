This class allows for any script to instantly become a singleton object, while still inheriting 
functionality from MonoBehavior.

This is a very slow way to check this sort of thing, but Singletons are only supposed to be 
instanced once, and at scene load anyway. It's not likely that you could ever create enough 
singletons to cause a slowdown anyway.
